						<h4>Features</h4>
						<p>ARCMF is a great entry point for novice mission makers. Without a framework, making a mission can be a daunting task; gear scripts, weather scripts and all other sort of fluff has to be scripted, tested, and verified. With ARCMF, we've done that for you. Now, you can fully focus on your mission idea and bring it to life. No hassle, no fluff.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6 text-center">
						<h4>Development</h4>
						<p>Currently, the original ARCMF Team is developing ARCMF2, a continuation of ARCMF. A lot of new features await, such as 3DEN Editor integration and much more. ARCMF2 will be all the more powerful, and all the more accessible to the newcomer. We already think it's great, and we aren't even done yet!</p>

					<div class="col-md-6 text-center">
						<p>Mission makers with a bit more experience will also find a lot of features to enjoy with ARCMF. <em>Everything</em> can be customised. Want to change automatic fireteam colors? Go do it. Want to change squad marker names? Go do it. Don't want to change anything? The don't, ARCMF has already done it for you.</p>

				<p>To contribute to ARCMF, head over to the <a href="https://github.com/ARCOMM/ARCMF">Github Repository</a>, fork the repo, and start making the changes you'd like. Once you are satisfied, you can make a <a href="https://github.com/ARCOMM/ARCMF/pulls">pull request</a>, which will be reviewed by the ARCMF Team and added to ARCMF if approved. This process requires some familiarity with git, SQF and a text editor of your choice, so please only do it this way if you have relevant experience. If you do not have enough experience to actively change things yourself, you are always welcome to drop a message to the ARCMF Team via Steam or open an <a href="https://github.com/ARCOMM/ARCMF/issues">Issue</a> on the Issues page.</p>
